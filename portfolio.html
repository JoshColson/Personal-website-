						<h1>
							Joshcolson.co.uk
						</h1>
						<p1> 
							This website you are reading now is my biggest creation and computer science achievement so far, outside of game creation. The decision to create my own website originated from my desire for a coding project full of new challenges and learning opportunities, as well as a need for a platform where I can detail all of my projects in one place. I created joshcolson.co.uk entirely by myself, using a mixture of html, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript.  
						</p1>
						<br><br>
						<p2>
							I used Visual Studio Code as a canvas to begin programming my vision of a minimalistic website. I wanted my website to be simplistic, whilst also featuring a variety of different functions to keep me engaging in fresh challenges. I feel the most demanding aspects of my website creation has been animation and forms, but these were also the amongst the most enjoyable. 
						</p2>
						<br><br>
						<p3>
							With each new challenge and difficult task, I am forever striving to strengthen my skills and discover new information and methods to help me. I still have many more ideas about what to code next, and I am excited to put these into action. Iâ€™m also planning my next professional development steps, including a formal postgraduate MSc in Computer Science, and projects in cyber security, python, and .NET, as well as a second website and more. I look forward to seeing where my tenacity for learning, exploring, and evolving within the subject are of computer science takes me next.
