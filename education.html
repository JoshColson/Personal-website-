								<h1 class= "fade-in"class="university-description">Falmouth University and Beyond</h1>
								
								<p1 class= "fade-in"class="university-description">Falmouth University was my first choice of institutions due to its unique offering of Marine & Natural History Photography BA(Hons). I was hesitant to enter a photography career, but enjoyed learning about myself, as well as strengthening my independent study and transferable skills. More importantly, I gained a stronger understanding of technology and the science of our natural world.</p1>
								<br><br>
								<p2 class= "fade-in"class="university-description">I continued to work on game design while studying, and moved on to a more <a href="gamedesign.html#section2">demanding project</a>, which included coding, graphic design, and using Unity to explore core game functions in a basic game model. I enjoyed the challenges of this project, but my limited time due to university commitments prevented me from taking the game any further.</p2>
								<br><br>
								<p3 class= "fade-in"class="university-description">University gave me the freedom I had longed for, and helped me to learn valuable skills. I discovered a lot about myself, including my drive for academic achievement. I finished my degree with a 2:2 BA(Hons).</p3>
								<br><br>
								<p4 class= "fade-in"class="university-description"> However, it was after graduating that I began to see the difference between my passion for photography, and the career-path I truly wanted to follow. I began working for a tech-orientated company, and now had the time and means to fully explore game creation. I began two coding projects;<a href="gamedesign.html#section3"> a basic functions game</a>, and a <a href="gamedesign.html#section4">more developed piece</a> which had more defined objective than my other games. The latter of these two projects also required more detailed graphic design to fit the purpose than my other projects. Whilst all aspects of the game creation gave me a sense of achievement, I was constantly eager to return to my code. I quickly realised that the aspect of game-design I truly enjoyed was the coding. I now fully realised that the pull of game-design, photography, and media had all been fuelled by my love for technology and coding.</p4>
								<br><br>
								<p5 class= "fade-in"class="university-description"> I now knew I wanted a career within coding, leading to <a href="portfolio.html">creation of my website.</a> After spending the last few years building my coding skills, I am now ready and excited for the next chapter of my path, where I hope to study Computer Science at postgraduate level, and begin my career in the field.</p5>

								<h1 class= "fade-in"class="college-description">City of Bath College</h1>
							
								<p1 class= "fade-in"class="college-description">College gave me the freedom to explore photography in its entirety without other courses alongside. It was at this stage where I was diagnosed with dyslexia, which helped with my workflow and understanding the best way to study, and I saw an improvement to my academic ability.</p1>
								<br><br><br>
								<p2 class= "fade-in"class="college-description"> I was determined the have a successful academic career, and going to University became my primary goal. This was my first real experience of a long-term goal, providing me with the motivation I needed.</p2>
								<br><br><br>
								<p3 class= "fade-in"class="college-description"> Studying photography at this level also helped me delve deeper into technology; I loved the technical side of using a camera, and enjoyed using media editing software. It was also during this time of my life where I began to explore my interest in game creation, sparked by a combination of my love of gaming, and some of the technological skills I gained whilst learning photography. I ventured into some online Unity tutorials, and began creating basic games.</p3>
								<br><br><br>
								<p4 class= "fade-in"class="college-description">  Despite some hurdles, I triumphantly completed my Photography Extended Diploma with Triple Merits (MMM), the grade needed to gain admission into my chosen university. This was one of my proudest achievements so far.</p4>

								<p1 class= "fade-in"class="sixthform-description">Leading on from my Media BTEC at secondary school, and my uncertainty on the right career path for me, I took Photography at AS level in Sixth Form. As this was still my most prevalent hobby at the time, it made the most sense to me.</p1>
								<br><br><br>
								<p2 class= "fade-in"class="sixthform-description"> However, whilst I was full of passion and drive for academic study and the desire to find a career path, I still felt as though I hadn’t found my calling. This led me to spend some time experimenting with a few subject areas during my time at Sixth Form, for example, Sports and Public services. This helped me narrow my search, but overall wasn’t the right choice for me.</p2>
								<br><br><br>
								<p3 class= "fade-in"class="sixthform-description"> I enjoyed sixth form, and learned a lot about myself at the time, but I craved the freedom to explore a single subject full time, and so moved onto study photography at college.</p3>

								<h1 class= "fade-in"class="school-description">Sir Bernard Lovell Secondary School</h1>
								
								<p1 class= "fade-in"class="school-description">At the age of 11, my dad bought me my first camera, which led to photography quickly becoming a hobby we both shared together. So, when it came to choosing my GCSEs—where I found myself struggling to visualise a career path—I decided to choose what I already knew best. This is what pushed me towards taking Media BTEC.  </p1>
								<br><br><br>
								<p2 class= "fade-in"class="school-description">Studying Media helped me find confidence, and I flourished more than in any other subject previously. A factor of this was the learning style of BTECs compared to GCSE’s, as, at the time, I was learning to cope with undiagnosed dyslexia.   </p2>
								<br><br><br>
								<p3 class= "fade-in"class="school-description">However, even though Media was the best choice for me at the time (and I overall enjoyed secondary school), I still felt as though I lacked direction. Despite this, I knew that I wanted to further explore the academic world, and I was adamant that my average grades would not hold me back, so went straight into sixth form.    </p3>
