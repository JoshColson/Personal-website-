						<h1>
							Game Design
						</h1>
						<p1>
							Game design set the foundation of my passion for coding, drawing from my interest in both gaming and technology. I began using Unity during college to create basic games, and so coding has been a consistent interest of mine through much of my education. Once I began more complex projects, I opened my eyes to a career within computer science. 
						</p1>
						<br><br>
						<p2>
							Below you can find a small collection of my game design projects, accompanied by a short commentary detailing my experience, motivations, and processes for each project. In between the games below, I have also worked on smaller pieces and tutorials to continue practising and learning, even when not working on larger ideas. 
						</p2>
						<br><br>
						<p3>
							Whilst my games are primitive, they were the perfect opportunity to experiment with various coding techniques, and my learning increased with every project.  
						</p3>
						<br><br>
						<p4>
							Follow the arrows below to find snippets of each game. You can also find a Github link next to each project, if you want to take a closer look.

							My First Game 
						</h1>
						<br>

							Language: C#

							Programs used: Unity, Photoshop, Visual Studio Code 
						</p1>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p2>
							I began my first game in university, which, despite its limited size and complexity, allowed me to experiment with coding collisions, assets, and animation. This was the first project where I also took on the task of graphic design, which gave the game a greater sense of completion than my previous projects.  
						</p2>
						<br><br>
						<p3>
							Various online tutorials were the bedrock of this creation, complimented by using snippets of examples and tutorials. This kickstarted the skill of debugging, and introduced me to the numerous resources and help guides available online. The wealth of information and online support via Stackoverflow, Microsoft support pages, and Unity support pages, was vital in my self-education. This also laid the foundations for me going forward, as learning to investigate and adapt online resources played a major role in all future projects to follow. 
						</p3>
						<br><br>
						<p4>
							I enjoyed the learning process and creativity of this project, and had a strong sense of satisfaction whilst working on it. Eventually, it was overshadowed by the ever-growing demand of work needed during my university course at the time, which prevented me from taking the project any further. When returning to Unity after I completed my degree, I was keen to try new things and move forward, and so my second game came into existence.

						<h1>
							My Second Game 
						</h1>

							I began my second game after graduating university, having started full-time work for a technology-oriented company. During my free time, I could be found coding away, exploring different game ideas and tutorials more so than ever before, and I settled on this as my second, full project.    
						</p2>
						<br><br>
						<p3>
							I used an online YouTube tutorial to kickstart this project. This helped me establish the game’s foundation, but it quickly developed beyond the tutorial when I began adding new levels, challenges, and features.  
						</p3>
						<br><br>
						<p4>
							This was also my first attempt at working with three dimensions, which brought new challenges and obstacles to overcome. Time spent researching online information helped me navigate this new area, and bridged a gap where I lacked formal education. As demonstrated in the example screenshot, the code snippets also started to become more complex than I’d previously worked with, providing me with the confidence I needed to further experiment.   
						</p4>
						<br><br>
						<p5>
							This project did not officially end, but instead transformed into my third game, where I took what I had learned and began working on a game with a similar but far more substantial structure and time investment.

							My Third Game 
						</h1>
						<br>
						<p1>
							Language: C#
							<br>
							Programs used: Unity, Photoshop, Visual Studio Code, Blender
						</p1>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p2>
							After inspiration struck from my second project, I began my third game; my largest and most challenging project so far. Having already worked on some basic game coding, I wanted to extend my knowledge and skills into something more complex.
						</p2>
						<br><br>
						<p3>
							The concept of this game is an ‘endless runner’ style driving game, with a goal of avoiding traffic and collisions to reach the end. The score is calculated depending on various factors, including the ‘death-count’, as well as ‘close calls’ with nearby traffic. I wanted this game to predominantly be suitable for use on mobile devices, which affected how I optimised and developed the game.  I also experimented with other coding challenges and territories, such as score multipliers, menu systems, death counters, in depth gravity and control systems, pickups, boost pads and more. This project is where I learned the most about game design, illustration, asset creation, coding, and game creation. I also had the chance to use unfamiliar software, such as Blender, where I created each three-dimensional asset. 
						</p3>
						<br><br>
						<p4>
							Eventually, when developing the eleventh level and planning my long-term goals for the game, I came to my biggest realisation yet; whilst all aspects of the game creation gave me a sense of achievement, working on the code was by far my favourite challenge, and I constantly longed to get back to it whenever working on the other aspects of my games. I quickly realised that the coding of the games brought me the most satisfaction, and was the main source of my enjoyment.
						</p4>
						<br><br>
						<p5>
							This realisation is what drew me to explore more coding focused challenges such as Edabit, <a href="portfolio.html">website creation</a> (this website you are reading now), animation, and a long-term career within computer science.
